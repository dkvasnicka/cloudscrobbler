Cloudscrobbler
==============

A Mixcloud-to-Last.fm scrobbling daemon

**WARNING:** Mixcloud.com introduced Last.fm support a few days after I've finished a first basic version of this app. Therefore this application makes no longer sense and is here only for educational / warning purposes :)

This app was destined to run on OpenShift PaaS (and thus developed using JBoss 7 on my local machine). It is written using Java EE 6 (EJB 3.1, CDI, JSF 2), a bit of Clojure and uses MongoDB as a data store.

Logo was created using VectorDesigner for Mac.
